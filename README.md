# IPv4-Detector

### A code that would detect your IPv4 address and your geolocation

This code uses the requests, statistics and math python libraries. When you will run the code, it detects your IPv4 address and through the help of it, will detect you rough geolocation. Although this code may get an accuracy of around 98% you can double check the IPv4 with the official DNS Leak Test website.
